KinematicChainSol.py

   This is the solution code for Kinematic Chains (HW5 Problem 5).

   chain = KinematicChain(node, basefame, tipframe, expectedjointnames)

      Initialize the kinematic chain, reading from the URDF message on
      the topic '/robot_description', sent by the robot_state_publisher.
      Determine the kinematic steps walking from the baseframe to the
      tipframe.  This expects the active joints to match the given names.

   (ptip, Rtip, Jv, Jw) = chain.fkin(q)

      Compute the forward kinematics and report the results.
